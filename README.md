Just double click on 'index.html' after extracting the zip file to run the code.

The only thing that doesn't work is when it should be game over, but there is a diagonal node not taken, but it would go through a line so it is not valid. 

Everything else should work, I tried to test all the edge cases / possibilites and I'm pretty sure I caught them all.
